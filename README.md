# Build
To compile this project, you need to pull the Chromium project first. For the documentation of the Chromium project, please refer to: https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code/

After pulling Chromium, apply the patch file under patches to the chromium project:
```
git am --reject patches/*.patch
```

If there is a .reject after the patch, you need to manually resolve the conflict

Add to the .gclient file

```
    "custom_vars": {
      "checkout_radium": True,
    },
```

After that you need to re-run `gclient sync`. Then you can start compiling
```shell
autoninja -C out/xxx radium
```

Currently based on chromium main branch (commit: 4a21fad763705b6a4996c5cf07758f8cd185c78d. Each rebase will update the commit value). Synchronize chromium repository code every week.
